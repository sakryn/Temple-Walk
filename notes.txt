Included a small loading text to appear after the start button is pressed. (DONE)

Imported the rest of the audio/sfx
Made a js file that plays the audio in order. Will be built further upon in the future
To make sure the player can't go to the next level while dialogue is being spoken, I added a global variable called exitEnabled. 
Now, only after dialogue is spoken (using keys 1-5), you'll be able to move on to the next level.

Imported Hiro and added him to the scene.
Dialogue now runs when you come close enough to him
    Will need collision detection on him so the player can't walk through him?
Created a teleport hiro function. He now appears near each level exit.
