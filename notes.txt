Created a new function file for the background music player. 
It'll be simpler to have each function in their own js file.

Able to change the background (level) via number keys 1-5. 
When you do, I made code to teleport the player to the center of the new level.

I have created an "exit cube" that changes color when the player comes close to it.
This will be developed further to allow the player to exit the level when they touch it, using the 
background changing function that's already in place.
