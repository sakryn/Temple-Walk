Position Hiro lower
Make Hiro move less when I move (edge)
Animation rotation fix to make right


const hiro = document.getElementById("hiro");
let rotation = hiro.getAttribute("rotation");
hiro.setAttribute("rotation",{x:0, y:90, z:0})

z = 0
x = 0


Figure out Hiro's rotation




Modified the face-player function. 
    Hiro now rotates only in the y-axis, preventing him from tilting up/down when the player gets close.
Positioned Hiro lower by half a unit.
