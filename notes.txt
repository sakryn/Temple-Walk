Make Hiro move less when I move (edge)



 hiro.setAttribute("gltf-model", "hiro-animations/Animation_Running_withSkin.glb");




Modified the face-player function. 
    Hiro now rotates only in the y-axis, preventing him from tilting up/down when the player gets close.
Positioned Hiro lower by half a unit.
Imported all animation assets, giving a unique id to each.
Created rotationCorrection function to account for model rotations, so that each animation faces the player.
Animation fixed!!!
