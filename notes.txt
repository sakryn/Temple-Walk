Make Hiro move less when I move (edge)
    Due to his small size, irregardless of distance. Would have to make him bigger but that would ruin the effect.
Animation transition "flicker" still a problem

Changed the animation slightly. There is now a copy of Hiro in the same position of the character, preset to the talking animation.
This "mirror" becomes visible (and Hiro invisible) during dialogue, meant to imitate a transition into dialogue.


        if (typeof preloadModel === "function") {
            preloadModel("Hiro_03");
        }

        // Crossfade or blend to the new model/animation if supported
        if (typeof crossfadeModel === "function") {
            crossfadeModel("Hiro_03");
        } else {
            changeModel("Hiro_03");
        }
