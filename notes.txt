changeExit implemented at a basic level. levelExits now look thematically appropriate.
Got the cursor to be visible again.
Created a spin animation for the level exits
Changed the way an intersection between the player and an exit is detected, in order to account for the unique exit shapes.
    I've kept the original intersection detection method in case it is needed later.
    Need feedback on whether the new method is better or worse.
