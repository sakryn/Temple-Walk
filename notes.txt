Found a tentative way to access Hiro's rotation values. Still working on it though.

( ^ DONE)



Position Hiro lower
Make Hiro move less when I move (edge)
Animation rotation fix to make right




const hiro = document.getElementById("hiro");

let rotation = hiro.getAttribute("rotation");

hiro.setAttribute("rotation", {x:0, y:90, z:0});
