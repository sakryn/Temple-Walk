Fixed a bug for the dialogue in level 3. The full dialogue is now spoken, and the bowl changes on command.
Brushed up the captions. Before, the previous caption appeared briefly before being switched. Now the proper caption appears immediately.
Applied the new animation transition style to all scenes.
